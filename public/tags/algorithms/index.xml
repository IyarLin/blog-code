A/B tests are the gold standard for estimating causal effects in product analytics. But in many cases they aren’t feasible. One of the most common ones is the feature release.
In this post I’ll discuss the common practice of measuring feature release impact using simple “before-after” analyses, biases that often plague such comparisons and how they can be better handled.</description>

      <description>Intro On my last few posts I’ve tried answering high level questions such as “What is Causal inference?”, “How is it different than ML?” and “When should I use it?”.
In this post we finally get our hands dirty with some Kaggle style Causal Inference algorithms bake off! In this competition I’ll pit some well known ML algorithms vs a few specialized Causal Inference (CI) algorithms and find out who’s hot and who’s not!</description>
