      <description>Learning to survive
On a previous post I made the case that survival analysis is essential for better churn prediction. My main argument was that churn is not a question of “who” but rather of “when”.
In the “when” question we ask when will a subscriber churn? Put differently how long does a subscriber stay subscribed on average? We can then answer one of the most important questions: What is the average subscriber life time value?</description>

First off - I’m excited to share this blog was instrumental in earning me a position as senior data scientist at Loops - a startup that builds an automated analytics platform for product and growth teams.
One of it’s primary selling points is the application of advanced causal inference methodologies to uncover opportunities from observational data.
This happened a little over a year ago and during that time I’ve been quite busy developing causal inference methodologies for real world applications.</description>
