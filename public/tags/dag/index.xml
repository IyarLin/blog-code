      <description>Intro Weâ€™ve seen on a previous post that one of the main differences between classic ML and Causal Inference is the additional step of using the correct adjustment set for the predictor features.
In order to find the correct adjustment set we need a DAG that represents the relationships between all features relevant to our problem.
One way of obtaining the DAG would be consulting domain experts. That however makes the process less accessible to wide audiences and more manual in nature.</description>
