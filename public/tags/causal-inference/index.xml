      <description>It is not often that I find myself thinking “man, I wish we had in R that cool python library!”. That is however the case with the dowhy library which “provides a unified interface for causal inference methods and automatically tests many assumptions, thus making inference accessible to non-experts”.
Luckily enough though, the awesome folks at Rstudio have written the reticulate package just for that sort of occasion: It “provides a comprehensive set of tools for interoperability between Python and R”.</description>

      <description>Intro On my last few posts I’ve tried answering high level questions such as “What is Causal inference?”, “How is it different than ML?” and “When should I use it?”.
In this post we finally get our hands dirty with some Kaggle style Causal Inference algorithms bake off! In this competition I’ll pit some well known ML algorithms vs a few specialized Causal Inference (CI) algorithms and find out who’s hot and who’s not!</description>

      <description>On my last post I gave an intuitive demonstration of what’s causal inference and how it’s different than classic ML.
After receiving some feedback I realize that while the post was easy to digest, some confusion remains. In this post I’ll delve a bit deeper into what the “causal” in Causal Inference actually means.
Analyzing the effect of X on Y The field of Causal inference deals with the question of “How does X affect Y?</description>

      <description>Machine learning applications have been growing in volume and scope rapidly over the last few years. What’s Causal inference, how is it different than plain good ole’ ML and when should you consider using it? In this post I try giving a short and concrete answer by using an example.
A typical data science task Imagine we’re tasked by the marketing team to find the effect of raising marketing spend on sales.</description>
