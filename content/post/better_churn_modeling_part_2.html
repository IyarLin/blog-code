<p>On a previous <a href="https://iyarlin.github.io/2022/06/08/better_churn_modeling/">post</a>
I made the case that survival analysis is essential for better churn prediction.
My main argument was that churn is not a question of “who” but rather of “when”.</p>
<p>In the “when” question we ask when will a subscriber churn? Put differently how
long does a subscriber stay subscribed on average? We can then answer one of the
most important questions: What is the average subscriber life time value?</p>
<div id="the-survival-curve" class="section level1">
<h1>The survival curve</h1>
<p>Let’s roll up our sleeves and dive right in: The survival curve <span class="math inline">\(S(t)\)</span> measures
the probability a subscriber will “survive” (not churn) until time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> since starting
his subscription. For example <span class="math inline">\(S(3)=0.8\)</span> means a subscriber has %80 chance of
not churning by the <span class="math inline">\(3^{rd}\)</span> month of subscription.</p>
<p>The most common way of estimating <span class="math inline">\(S(t)\)</span> is by using the Kaplan-Meier curve who’s
formula is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\hat{S}(t) = \Pi_{t_i \leq t}\left(1-\frac{d_i}{n_i}\right)\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(t_i\)</span> are all times where at least one subscriber has churned, <span class="math inline">\(d_i\)</span> is the number
of subscribers who have churned at time <span class="math inline">\(t_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n_i\)</span> is the number of subscribers
who survived till at least <span class="math inline">\(t_i\)</span>. The term <span class="math inline">\(\frac{d_i}{n_i}\)</span> is then the probability
of churning at time <span class="math inline">\(t_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>To illustrate let’s calculate the survival curve for the following subscriber data:</p>
<table style="width:38%;">
<colgroup>
<col width="18%" />
<col width="5%" />
<col width="13%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="center">subscriber</th>
<th align="center">t</th>
<th align="center">churned</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center">1</td>
<td align="center">3</td>
<td align="center">0</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="center">2</td>
<td align="center">6</td>
<td align="center">1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center">3</td>
<td align="center">2</td>
<td align="center">1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="center">4</td>
<td align="center">1</td>
<td align="center">0</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center">5</td>
<td align="center">2</td>
<td align="center">0</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="center">6</td>
<td align="center">2</td>
<td align="center">1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The column <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> denotes the time a user has been subscribed until today. If he churned
that would be the time till he churned.</p>
<p>We have 2 times at which churn events happend: <span class="math inline">\(t_i = \{2,6\}\)</span>.</p>
<p>For <span class="math inline">\(t &lt; 2\)</span> we have <span class="math inline">\(S(t)=1\)</span> since no one churned up to that point.</p>
<p>At <span class="math inline">\(t_1=2\)</span> we have <span class="math inline">\(d_1=2\)</span> (subscribers 3 and 6) and
<span class="math inline">\(n_1=5\)</span> (all subscribers but 4). Using the above formula we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[S(2) = 1-\frac{2}{5} = 0.6\]</span></p>
<p>At <span class="math inline">\(t_2=6\)</span> we have <span class="math inline">\(d_2=1\)</span> (subscriber 2) and <span class="math inline">\(n_2=1\)</span> (again, just subscriber 2).</p>
<p>We thus have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[S(6) = \left(1-\frac{2}{5}\right) \cdot \left(1-\frac{1}{1}\right) = 0\]</span></p>
<p>Let’s plot that curve:</p>
<p><img src="/post/better_churn_modeling_part_2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>One thing to notice here is that at that every point along the curve we only consider subscribers who survived up to that point. If a subscriber joined very recently (e.g. subscriber 4) he won’t play a major role in the calculation.</p>
<p>In practice you’d be better off using the survival curve implementation in the R <code>survival</code> package or the python <code>lifelines</code> library.</p>
<div id="expected-life-time" class="section level2">
<h2>Expected life time</h2>
<p>So why go through the hassle of calculating <span class="math inline">\(S(t)\)</span> in the first place? Turns
out that the expected life time is the area under the survival curve (I won’t go
into proving that here). If we denote the time at which a subscriber has churned
by <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> then:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E(T) = \int_0^{\infty}S(t)dt\]</span>
And in our example above: <span class="math inline">\(E(T) = 2\cdot 1 + 4 \cdot 0.6 = 4.4\)</span>. If a users’ monthly
plan bill is for example $10 then we can say that his expected LTV (life time value) is $44.</p>

<h2>Better answering the “who” question</h2>
<p>Sometimes we may actually be interested in the “who” question.
On my next post I’ll show that using survival curves we can better answer that question as well!</p>
