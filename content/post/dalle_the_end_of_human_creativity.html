<p>Usually I post about how I instruct machines to translate my ideas into scientific discovery. This time around I’d like to discuss something a bit different: How machines can help turn ideas into art.</p>
<p>About a month ago I was given early research access to the <a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/">DALL-E</a> neural net by OpenAI.
Fiddling with it for a few hours and skimming through different examples I was
mind blown by it’s capabilities.</p>
<p>But just as you start to wonder if DALL-E marks the start of the end for human creativity, you start to notice something very subtle.</p>
<p>The truly “artistic” creations of DALL-E have to be given a solid artistic context. You’d need to cue it with an artistic style or medium in order for it to generate something coherent. Otherwise its creations seem rather confused and half-baked. The range of references you can feed it with is huge - way more than my cultural education. That in itself can really give someone pause and make them feel small.</p>
<p>In the end however, DALL-E, like any other AI is a referencing machine. It’s like a guy that knows all the jokes and opening lines from all sitcoms and rom-coms ever broadcasted. It can be really impressive at a party but that guy won’t invent the next “friends” or “Seinfeld”.</p>
<p>At its core, it still lacks true “creativity” to invent new styles or references. Unless something fundamentally changes in the way we build AI this will always be the case.</p>
<p>Having said all that DALL-E is super fun. Checkout my digital exhibition <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/a4spmCQyXm86wKmb6">“A Sphinx cat and a Pug”</a>, co-created by DALL-E and myself!</p>
