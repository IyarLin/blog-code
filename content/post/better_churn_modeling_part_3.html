<p>On previous posts (<a href="https://iyarlin.github.io/2022/06/08/better_churn_modeling/">part

2</a>)
I made the case that survival analysis is essential for better churn
prediction. My main argument was that churn is not a question of “who”
but rather of “when”.</p>
<p>In this post I’ll demonstrate that even when we’re interested with the
“who” question (0/1 churn indicator) it’s often preferable to use survival analysis rather than simple classification.</p>
<p>Specifically I’ll show that using survival analysis we can detect
changes to churn rates much earlier than when using the classification
approach.</p>
<div id="simulation-study" class="section level1">
<h1>Simulation study</h1>
<p>Going back to the classic cellphone subscribers example: imagine we’d like to
monitor 30-day churn in new subscribers. For users who joined after May 1st 2023 we’ll simulate their subscription time before churning <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> using a Weibull distribution with shape parameter <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{\text{pre}} =\)</span> 0.18 and scale
parameter <span class="math inline">\(\sigma = 30,000\)</span>. The 30 day churn rate in this case is 25.1% (<span class="math inline">\(P(T_{\alpha_{\text{pre}}} \leq 30)=\)</span> 0.251).</p>
<p>After July 1st we’ll simulate users’ subscription time using a Weibull distribution
with shape parameter <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{\text{pre}}=\)</span> 0.16 and scale
parameter <span class="math inline">\(\sigma = 30,000\)</span>. The 30 day churn rate in this case is 28.2%.</p>
<p>Below we can see the survival curves for both periods:</p>

<div id="churn-monitoring-using-classification" class="section level1">
<h1>Churn monitoring using classification</h1>
<p>To measure 30 day churn using classification we’ll take a cohort of users who
joined 30 to 37 days ago and label those with subscription time less than 30 days
as churned and the rest as none churned.</p>
<p>Below we plot the churn rate over time, with the dashed purple line indicating the date after which the heightened churn rate users started joining:</p>
<p><img src="/post/better_churn_modeling_part_3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We can see that the 30 day churn rate started rising only a month after
the heightened churn users started joining!</p>

<h1>Churn monitoring done the right way - with survival analysis</h1>
<p>When using survival analysis however we can use all users when
constructing the survival curve. Let’s see how the survival estimate
compares with the classification one:</p>
<p><img src="/post/better_churn_modeling_part_3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" />
We can see that indeed the survival estimate upticks much earlier than the classification
one! We can also the estimate is more stable.</p>
<div id="in-summary" class="section level2">
<h2>In summary</h2>
<p>In this post we’ve seen yet another scenario where using survival analysis is
preferable to using classification: Monitoring churn rates using survival can
help us detect changes in churn much faster compared with classification.</p>
